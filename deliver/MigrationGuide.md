## deliver migration guide to 1.0

### Why breaking changes?

Originally `deliver` was designed to be "The Continuous Delivery tool for iOS". With the introduction of [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools) many things have changed. It was time for a big rewrite for `deliver`, which is one of the most popular tools of the [fastlane toolchain](https://fastlane.tools).

### What do I have to do to get my setup working again?

In general, check out the latest documentation for the [Deliverfile](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/deliver/Deliverfile.md).

With 1.0 the app will not be submitted to Review by default. You can use the `deliver --submit_for_review` to submit after the upload.

#### Standard Setups (one app)

The easiest way is to remove the existing `Deliverfile` (which is probably almost empty anyway) and clear the `metadata` folder and run `deliver init`, so that `deliver` creates everything in the new format for you.

#### Advanced Setups

To manually migrate setups (especially if you make heavy use of the `Deliverfile`):

Make sure to adapt the paths to include the `fastlane` directory (if necessary).

**The following options have been removed from the `Deliverfile`:**

Removed     | Use instead              | Note

`version` | `app_version` | is usually automatically detected

- `deliver` now uses [spaceship](https://spaceship.airforce) to communicate with ï£¿. This has *huge* advantages over the old way, which means `deliver` is now much faster and more stable :rocket: 
- Removed a lot of legacy code. Did you know `deliver` is now one year old? A lot of things have changed since then
- Improved the selection of the newly uploaded build and waiting for processing to be finished, which is possible thanks to `spaceship`
- Updating the app metadata and uploading of the screenshots now happen using `spaceship` instead of the iTunes Transporter, which means changes will immediately visible after running `deliver` :sparkles: 
- Removed the `deliver beta` and `testflight` commands, as there is now a dedicated tool called [pilot](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/pilot)
- All parameters are now in the config system, which means you can pass values using the `Deliverfile`, from within your `Fastfile` or as command line parameter

- The preview doesn't highlight changes with blue any more
- Screenshot are uploaded every time. This is on the [next-tasks list](https://github.com/fastlane/deliver/issues/353)

If you run into any issues with the new version of `deliver` please submit an issue on GitHub.
